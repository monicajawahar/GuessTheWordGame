# Guess The Word Game

The Word Guessing Game is a simple project developed using python. This game is about guessing letters (A-Z) to form the words. If the player guesses the right letter that is within the word, the letter appears at its correct positions. The user can get the chance to guess the correct word until 5 turns, then the game is over. 

About the Game
You can use CLI mode to run the game in the console. Here, all the playing methods are the same, all you (users) have to do is to guess the correct letters to form the correct word before guessing turns are over. If you cannot guess the correct word, you will see that word with the message. Also, to start the new game, you can enter yes or y.
